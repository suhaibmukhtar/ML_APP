# Multi-Tasking Data Analysis App
# Overview
This multi-tasking data analysis app performs three main tasks on a dataset containing 35,000 rows and 18 features. The tasks include unsupervised machine learning using DBSCAN clustering, multiclass classification using Logistic Regression and SVM, and the calculation of duration of time and number of picks and place. The app is built using Python and Flask framework for the web interface.

## Tasks Performed
Unsupervised ML - DBSCAN Clustering:
DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) clustering algorithm is utilized for unsupervised clustering.
The algorithm identifies clusters based on density within the dataset without requiring prior knowledge of the number of clusters.
DBSCAN is effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise.
## Multiclass Classification - Logistic Regression and SVM:
Multiclass classification tasks are performed using Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms.
Logistic Regression and SVM are supervised learning algorithms used for classification tasks.
The models are trained to predict the class labels based on the features provided in the dataset.
## Calculation of Duration and Number of Picks and Place:
The app calculates the duration of time and the number of picks and place based on the dataset's features.
Specific algorithms or techniques used for these calculations are not mentioned but can be further detailed in the code documentation.
## Dataset
The dataset consists of 35,000 rows and 18 features.
Features include various attributes relevant to the analysis tasks performed by the app.
## Technologies Used
Python for data analysis and machine learning tasks.
Flask framework for developing the web application interface.
## Run the Flask app:
Copy code
python app.py
Access the web interface using a web browser at the specified address.
## Future Enhancements
Incorporate additional machine learning algorithms and analysis techniques for more comprehensive data analysis.
Improve the user interface and visualization capabilities of the web app.
Optimize algorithms and enhance performance for larger datasets.
